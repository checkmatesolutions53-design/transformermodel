Transformer (Generative AI) â€” PyTorch Implementation
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a from-scratch Transformer-based Generative AI model written entirely in PyTorch.
It supports sequence-to-sequence learning and autoregressive text generation, with reusable PyTorch modules for embeddings, positional encodings, self-attention, feed-forward layers, and output projection.

The implementation is clean, extensible, and well-suited for learning, research, or custom generative tasks.

ðŸ”§ Architecture (PyTorch Components)

Tokenizer â†’ converts text into token IDs.

Input Embeddings â†’ implemented with nn.Embedding, scaled by the square root of the model dimension.

Positional Encoding â†’ added to embeddings to inject order information, implemented using sinusoidal or learned vectors.

Transformer Blocks â†’ each block contains:

Multi-head self-attention (nn.MultiheadAttention) with causal masking for autoregressive tasks.

Residual connections with nn.LayerNorm.

Position-wise feed-forward network (nn.Linear layers with nonlinearity).

Decoder-only Stack â†’ multiple Transformer blocks are stacked for generative modeling.

Output Projection Layer â†’ a linear mapping from hidden states to vocabulary logits for next-token prediction.

âœ¨ Inference

The trained model supports autoregressive generation.

Greedy decoding: selects the most probable token at each step.

Sampling: adds diversity with temperature scaling, top-k, or nucleus (top-p) sampling.

Early stopping: generation halts when an end-of-sequence token is produced.

ðŸš€ Extensions & Improvements

This PyTorch-based implementation is easily extensible with:

Pre-LayerNorm architectures for deeper training stability.

Relative positional embeddings (ALiBi, Rotary) for longer contexts.

GELU activation (nn.GELU) instead of ReLU.

LoRA or adapter layers for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Mixed precision training with torch.cuda.amp for faster performance.

Quantization with PyTorchâ€™s native APIs for deployment efficiency.

Export to ONNX for serving in production environments.
